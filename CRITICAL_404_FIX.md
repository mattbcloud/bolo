# Critical: Repository Must Be Public for GitHub Pages

You're still getting 404 errors, which means GitHub Pages isn't serving your site.

## The #1 Cause: Private Repository

**GitHub Pages REQUIRES a public repository** (unless you have GitHub Pro/Enterprise).

## âš¡ Quick Fix - Make Repository Public:

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Go to your repository settings:**
   ```
   https://github.com/mattbcloud/bolo/settings
   ```

2. **Scroll ALL THE WAY to the bottom** of the page

3. **Find the "Danger Zone" section** (it's in a red box at the very bottom)

4. **Click "Change repository visibility"**

5. **Select "Make public"**

6. **Type your repository name** to confirm: `mattbcloud/bolo`

7. **Click "I understand, change repository visibility"**

8. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for GitHub to rebuild Pages

9. **Try the URL again:**
   ```
   https://mattbcloud.github.io/bolo/orona/index.html?local
   ```

## Alternative Check: Verify GitHub Pages Settings

If your repository IS already public, check the Pages configuration:

1. **Go to Pages settings:**
   ```
   https://github.com/mattbcloud/bolo/settings/pages
   ```

2. **Verify these EXACT settings:**
   - **Source:** Deploy from a branch
   - **Branch:** `main`
   - **Folder:** `/docs`
   - **Custom domain:** (leave blank)

3. **Click Save** if you changed anything

4. **Look at the top of the page** - it should say:
   ```
   âœ… Your site is live at https://mattbcloud.github.io/bolo/
   ```

## Check Deployment Status

1. **Go to Actions tab:**
   ```
   https://github.com/mattbcloud/bolo/actions
   ```

2. **Look for "pages build and deployment"**

3. **Status should be:**
   - âœ… **Green checkmark** = Successfully deployed
   - ðŸ”´ **Red X** = Failed (click to see error)
   - ðŸŸ¡ **Yellow/orange** = Still running

## Quick Checklist

Please check and tell me the status of each:

- [ ] **Repository is PUBLIC** (not private)
  - Check at: https://github.com/mattbcloud/bolo
  - Look for a "Public" badge next to the repo name

- [ ] **GitHub Pages is enabled**

- [ ] **Source is set correctly**
  - Branch: `main`
  - Folder: `/docs`

- [ ] **Latest deployment succeeded**
  - Actions tab shows green checkmark

- [ ] **Waited 2-3 minutes** after enabling/configuring

## What to Tell Me

Please check your repository and tell me:

1. **Is your repository Public or Private?**
   - Look at the top of https://github.com/mattbcloud/bolo
   - It will say "Public" or "Private" next to the repo name

2. **What do you see in Settings â†’ Pages?**
   - Is there a green box saying "Your site is live"?
   - Or is there a blue box with configuration options?

3. **What's in the Actions tab?**
   - Are there any "pages build and deployment" workflows?
   - What color are they (green, red, yellow)?

## Most Likely Solution

**I'm 99% sure your repository is set to Private.**

Making it Public will immediately fix the 404 error.
