# Finding the Orona Folder on GitHub

## ✅ Good News: The Folder IS There!

I verified that all 51 orona files ARE pushed to your main branch. You're just looking in the wrong place!

---

## 📂 Step-by-Step: How to Find It

### **Step 1: Go to Your Repository**
```
https://github.com/mattbcloud/bolo
```

### **Step 2: Make Sure You're on the MAIN Branch**

Look at the top left of the page. You'll see a branch dropdown that says:
```
main  ▼
```

**If it says anything else** (like a feature branch name), click it and select **"main"**

### **Step 3: Click on the `docs` Folder**

In the file list, you'll see:
```
📁 docs/
📄 CRITICAL_404_FIX.md
📄 DEBUG_LIVE_SITE.md
📄 GITHUB_PAGES_SETUP.md
... (other files)
```

**Click on `docs/`**

### **Step 4: You Should See `orona` Folder**

Inside docs/, you should see:
```
📁 orona/
📄 index.html
```

**Click on `orona/`**

### **Step 5: Verify Contents**

Inside docs/orona/, you should see:
```
📁 css/
📁 images/
📁 js/
📁 maps/
📁 sounds/
📄 README.md
📄 index.html
```
